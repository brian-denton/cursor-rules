# Testing Setup Guide

This project uses two main testing frameworks:

- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests. Configuration is in [`jest.config.cjs`](mdc:jest.config.cjs). Custom setup files are in [`jest.setup.js`](mdc:jest.setup.js).
- Tests are run with the command `npx jest`
- ALWAYS fix failing tests automatically

Test files are typically located in `__tests__` directories or alongside the code they test. See [`TESTING.md`](mdc:TESTING.md) for more details and best practices.
